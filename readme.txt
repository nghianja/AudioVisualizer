This application is just a reference implementation showcasing the use of the following two open libraries:

- Java translation of fftpack [http://www.netlib.org/fftpack/jfftpack.tgz]
- GraphView [https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView]

It is by no means an optimized implementation so users should notice the considerable lag in the display. Users are advised to incorporate into their own codes by rewriting it.

Usage:

1. Click on the "microphone" icon to start recording of audio.
2. Click on the "settings" icon to switch between time analysis and frequency analysis.
